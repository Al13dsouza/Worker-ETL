# Worker-ETL

## Description:
The Worker ETL Project is designed to demonstrate an Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) process between two MySQL databases. The project extracts data from a source database containing worker information and loads it into a target data warehouse database. This process is essential for integrating and consolidating data from different sources to a centralized data warehouse for further analysis and reporting.
